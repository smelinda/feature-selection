Feature selection could affect the quality of machine learning model. Various feature selection algorithm were proposed to effectively choose subsets of features for various application. We conducted analysis over feature selection approaches in terms of their scalability and performance in the distributed machine learning context to tackle large scale data. We implemented a parallel feature selection approach based on variance preservation on Apache Spark and tested it on the classification problem using the internet advertisements and YouTube multiview video games data set from UCI repository to verify its applicability on higher dimensional data and different distributed setting.
